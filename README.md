# canopyscreensaver
This screensaver was lovingly made in Gainesville Florida from the tree canopy above a previous apartment I rented. The inspiration was the Beastie Boys music video "So What Cha Want".

These install instructions are a bit old but still works if you don't mind getting your hands a little dirty- Enjoy!
